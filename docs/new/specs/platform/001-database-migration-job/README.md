# 001 — Database migration job

**Module:** platform
**Type:** migration
**Status:** in-progress
**Owner:** backend team
**Created:** 2026-07-29

Move EF Core schema migration execution out of the Cloud Run API startup path and into the root `Host.Jobs` executable. The approved production path resets the non-critical Identity schema and migration history, then recreates it through the current Guid-based initial migration. The API must start without attempting to alter a database schema.

## Scope

- Reset only the approved non-critical Identity tables and their historical migration rows after a fresh backup.
- Add an explicit, one-shot `--job=migrate` mode to `src/Bootstrapper/Host.Jobs/Host.Jobs/Host.Jobs.csproj` and its executable.
- Run migrations serially for all registered contexts with structured logs and a non-zero exit code on failure.
- Remove automatic migration execution from `Host.Api` startup.
- Update the Cloud Run deployment workflow so the migration job completes successfully before a new API revision is deployed.

## Out of scope

- Changing application HTTP contracts or domain behavior.
- Recreating, deleting, or manually editing Catalog or Sales production tables.
- Changing unrelated 1C import jobs.

## Requirements

- [Overview and scope](requirements/overview.md)
- [Migration safety](requirements/migration-safety.md)

## Technical design

- [Domain and ownership](design/domain.md)
- [Infrastructure and rollout](design/infrastructure.md)
- [Approved Identity reset SQL](design/identity-reset.sql.md)
- [Data model](data-model.md)

## Delivery

- [API/integration contract](contracts/api-contract.md)
- [Specification readiness](checklist/spec-readiness.md)
- [Delivery readiness](checklist/delivery-readiness.md)

## AI implementation tasks

AI performs only unfinished tasks in the current phase, marks completed tasks as `[x]`, and proceeds only after the checkpoint. `[P]` indicates safe parallel execution after dependencies are complete.

| Phase | Result |
| --- | --- |
| [00 — Readiness](tasks/00-readiness.md) | confirmed production baseline and rollback plan |
| [01 — Migration lineage](tasks/01-migration-lineage.md) | compatible Identity migration history and forward-only delta |
| [02 — Root migration job](tasks/02-root-migration-job.md) | explicit root migration job with safe exit behavior |
| [03 — Deployment orchestration](tasks/03-deployment-orchestration.md) | API startup is schema-neutral; CI runs the job first |
| [04 — API](tasks/04-api.md) | not applicable; no HTTP contract is introduced |
| [05 — Verification](tasks/05-verification.md) | disposable and production rollout evidence |
