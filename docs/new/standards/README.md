# Backend engineering rules

This directory contains the stable rules for every backend change. It does not contain frontend rules: the frontend is a separate project.

- [Backend rules](backend-rules.md) — layers, CQRS, DDD, Mediator, and code organisation.
- [Identifier strategy](identifier-strategy.md) — mandatory ID-selection rules before creating or changing an entity.
- [API rules](api-rules.md) — HTTP contracts, validation, results, and errors.
- [Database rules](database-rules.md) — EF Core, reads, transactions, migrations, and data.
- [Security and observability rules](security-observability-rules.md) — authorization, privacy, Serilog, and diagnostics.
- [Testing rules](testing-rules.md) — scenario coverage, Red -> Green -> Refactor,
  test selection, exceptions, and required verification commands.
- [Delivery rules](delivery-rules.md) — behavior-first SDD flow, traceability,
  scope, and definition of done.

Feature specifications link to these rules rather than duplicating them.
